1.9 Beta:
    - Fixed Need to reset width, color, and text on rating preview on new videos, because when elements are recycled, the video will show the old stats for a bit and then swithc to the new video’s stats. Try scrolling on same link as above
    - Fixed Stats shouldn’t show for videos with incredibly low like/dislike counts.
    - Show likes/dislikes stats (using title) when hover over like/dislike bar
    - ratings preview can't be highlighted and hover mouse cursor is now "help"
    - added utils.js
