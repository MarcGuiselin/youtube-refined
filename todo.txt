Ideas:
    lazytube - use controller to navigate youtube

    pause/play videos playing in other tabs.  do bar on bottom kinda like this extension:
        https://i.imgur.com/WslFEj1.png
        https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-pro-new-layout-su/nghbohceegafefgfbbkkpbdiodckkgdd        

    show video as you scroll down

    block youtube tracking

    pause video on page visibily change (visibility change event)

    remove (MUST WATCH) [not fake] (not clickbait) (footage) (Cringe Warning) (ALMOST DIED) (official video)
        you never even noticed   you never even seen   you ever seen   you ever saw     so satisfying
        amazing video!  awesome video!  must watch!
        oddly satisfying      so satisfying

    Hide youtube red offers and videos

    if autoplay is enabled but next video is prevented from playing don't go to it

    mute parts of video with profanity using transcript.

    profanity filter

    kid mode - just enable restricted mode on youtube

Filters allow you to target and modify certain video suggestions by their titles, channel name, ect.
Use filters to blur the thumbnails of obnoxious channels, remove all videos about "aligator wrestling", or even change all the titles containing "chocolate cake" to "GIVE ME NOW!".
