                <h2>The quick context menu</h2>
                <p>
                    A little button will appear in various places on YouTube that allows you to quickly do things like block channels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note that if the video is matched by a filter you created, there will be no option to block or unblock the channel or video.</b>
                </p>

                <h2>Filter Settings</h2>
                <div class="new-line">
                    <h3>What is a filter?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A filter is a group of <span class="tag ch">&nbsp;channels</span>, <span class="tag vi">&nbsp;videos</span>, and <span class="tag sg">&nbsp;search tags</span> (ex: <span class="tag sg"><i>Video Title</i><span class="comparator">Starts With</span>Hello</span>) that share filter settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every video on youtube will be matched to one of your filters based off of it's channel name, video title, and video id.  Videos that don't match of any of your filters will match the <a href="#filter-0">default filter</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are filter settings?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each filter has settings which apply to every youtube video that matches any of that filter's tags.
                        With these settings, for example, you can blur video thumbnails from videos from some channels
                        and you could prevent some other channel's videos from showing up altogether, effectively blocking them.
                    </p>
                    <div class="new-line">
                        <gif-player preview="https://i.imgur.com/mEJ4Ccc.png" gif="https://i.imgur.com/PjsYOwU.gif"></gif-player>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Adding a channel to a filter</h3>
                    <p>
                        Click on the tag editor then click "Add new tag".  Click "Channel Name", then click "Equals", finally start typing the channel name and clicking on the one you would like to block.
                    </p>
                    <div class="new-line">
                        <gif-player preview="https://i.imgur.com/1EDHIf1.png" gif="https://i.imgur.com/jxET3aI.gif"></gif-player>
                    </div>
                    <h3>More complex filters</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tags can do a lot more than just targetting specific channel names.  For example the tag <span class="tag sg"><i>Channel Name</i><span class="comparator">Contains</span>News</span> could be used to target many news channels since their channel name contains "News".
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are autocorrection settings?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Youtube refined includes a complex text processing algorithm that can de-annoyify annoying video titles.  Remove hashtags, properly titlecase titles (so no more all-caps titles), and remove emoji characters with these settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Remember that titles will only be autorrected if the filter it matches specifies that video titles should be autocorrected.</b>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Grouped Filters (Advanced)</h3>
                    <p>
                        To allow you to more precisely tune up what video filters match, you can group tags together.  Click on the <span class="tag group"><span class="plus">+</span></span> in the tag editor to create a new grouped tag.  To match a grouped tag a video must match all of its individual tags.  For example the following grouped tag
                        <span class="tag group"><span class="tag ch">&nbsp;Voluminous Vlogs</span><span class="and">&nbsp;AND&nbsp;</span><span class="tag sg"><i>Video Title</i><span class="comparator">Contains</span>gameplay</span></span>
                        might be used to match "gameplay" videos from the channel "Voluminous Vlogs".
                    </p>
                    <h3>Filter order (Advanced)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Filter order matters meaning that first a video will first try to match your default filter, then blocked, then your other filters in order.  The first filter that it matches will be the one it, well, matches.  You can drag filters up and down using the handle bars to the left of each filter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>The default filter and blocked filters cannot be reordered, and so will always be first.</b>
                    </p>

                        Youtube refined has two main features: Filter settings and Suggestion settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Filter settings allow you to block or allow videos from some channels and customize how those video's information should show.  Suggestion settings allow you to get customized video suggestions from your favorite channels.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The quick context menu</h2>

                        <p>
                            The quick context menu is a little button that appears over video thumbnails, next to channel images, and in various other places that allows you to quickly contextually alter Youtube Refined's settings.
                            Clicking on it will provide you with some actions you can perform such as adding or removing that channel to the 'block' filter, temporarily showing or playing a blocked video, or accessing that video's filter settings.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Filter Settings</h2>

                        <p>
                            A filter is a group of <span class="tagPreview ch">channels</span>, <span class="tagPreview vi">videos</span>, and <span class="tagPreview st">search tags</span> (ex: <span class="tagPreview st">video title contains 'x'</span>, <span class="tagPreview st">video has more than 'x' views</span>, etc) that share filter settings.

                        <h3>What are filter settings?</h3>

                        <h3>What are censor settings?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The <a href="#censor">censor settings</a> page is where you can customize how videos or thumbnails are censored.
                            For example you can tweak the blur intensity of blurred videos or create customized thumbnails that will always show for certain channels.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What are autocorrection settings?</h3>

                            Youtube refined includes a complex text processing algorithm that can de-annoyify annoying video titles (<a href="http://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/dc9llkt6q4ckaautms8o/clickbait" target="_blank">This is what I mean</a>).  Remove hashtags, properly titlecase titles (so no more all-caps titles), and remove emoji characters with these settings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            IMPORTANT: Remember that titles will only be autorrected if in that video's filter setting specifies that it's title should be autocorrected.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How do I add a channel or video to a filter?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Either use the quick context menu mentioned above, or go to the <a href="#filters">Edit filters</a> page, click on the tag editor, click the plus arrow to add a new tab, type in your video title or channel, and click/use the arrow and enter keys to select the item you want from the search results.

                    <h2>Kid Mode</h2>
                    <div class="new-line">
                        <p>
                            Story time: Over last summer one of my buddies at work asked me to babysit his kids so he could go on a date with his wife.
                            Being the kind guy I am, I accepted even though I absolutely hate children.
                            Fortunately both kids turned out to be more interested in their computer screens than with bothering me.
                            When I checked on the youngest who was eating some snacks at the dinner table I was absolutely shocked by what this 9 year old kid was watching on youtube.
                            When I got back home I did a bit of research, and my findings were beyond awful.
                            Cringey elsa and spiderman parody videos making crude poop jokes, animated attrocities worst than teletubbies teaching kids colors, videos of kids making huge messes.
                            Videos with tens of millions of views, all kids.
                            This is a huge problem, and youtube actively pushes this kind of content to video suggestions trying to keep kids watching videos to generate ad revenue.
                            Youtube doesn't care about the safety of our kids, so I added this feature to help parents keep their kids safe.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                        <p>
                            When enabled <a href="#kidmode">Kid Mode</a> does a variety of things to keep your kids safe on youtube like blocking innapropriate channels. It isn't foolproof, but it should block mostly everything innapropriate.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How do I enable it?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Go to the <a href="#kidmode">Kid Mode</a> page and click the big enable button on the top of the page.

                    <p>Obviously this extension hasn't made itself.  I've spent thousands of hours on this project; not making a dime in the process.</p>
                    <p>Besides just supporting me, donating also helps pay for the steadily growing server and additional costs that come with keeping this extension up and running.</p>
